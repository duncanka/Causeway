    A very large part of our problem is that we have not yet found sufficient replacement for the discipline of a lender not lending to a borrower unless the lender is sure that the borrower will be able to repay. Something that simple causes problems in subprime, and it has caused problems elsewhere.
    If properly done, a market sensitive regulatory authority not only prevents some of the problems, but is pro-market, because we have investors now who are unwilling to invest even in things they should.
    To cause harm is bad.
