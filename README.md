# Causeway causal language tagger

Causeway is a system for detecting explicit causal relations in text. It tags text using the scheme described in [Dunietz et al., 2015](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jdunietz/publications/causal-language-annotation.pdf). The system itself is described in [Dunietz et al., 2017](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jdunietz/publications/causeway-system.pdf). The results described in that paper can be reproduced using the [`run_all_pipelines.sh`](https://github.com/duncanka/causeway/blob/master/Causeway/scripts/run_all_pipelines.sh) script and the data from the [BECauSE](https://github.com/duncanka/BECauSE) corpus.

Causeway depends on the [NLPypline](https://github.com/duncanka/NLPypline) framework for NLP pipelines. In addition, it depends on the `bidict` and `colorama` Python packages. It also depends on version 3.5.2 of the Stanford parser, including its TRegex and TSurgeon components. Using the TRegex version of Causeway requires appyling the patches in `stanford-patches` to the parser source code.

Note that the repository includes some code for reading in BECauSE data in a newer scheme than that described in the 2015 paper. This newer scheme is backwards-compatible with the original.

If you are interested in running/modifying the system or reproducing the results, please [contact Jesse Dunietz](mailto:jdunietz@cs.cmu.edu), who will be happy to assist. (Proper documentation will be written up if enough people express interest.)
